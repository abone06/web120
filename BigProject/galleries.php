<p>After doing some research about the Galleries to add in the website, I discover that there are several options and tools that can help me to add them in my website in a very easy way. The internet have different plugins that are free download using different coding languages like jQuerry, javascript, etc. This plugins include a slider bars to the website adding more efficiently working from any browser.  </p>

<p>There are so many amazing sliders and slideshows that it’s hard to decide what to pinpoint. But in my opinion you should definitely check out Gridder slider, because it’s really amazing what it can do, especially for free, so it’s a win-win situation.  </p>

<p>Creating a gallery slider bar could be challenging if you don’t know jQuerry or another programming language; however in the internet there are several plugins that can be useful for many users without this knowledge for example “Mighty Slider [can be an option that] you need to create an amazing one-directional slider. Mighty Slider can be used as a banner rotator, video gallery, presentation and basic slider. All of this is possible because of a very powerful API. Mighty Slider gives you total control over layout and design.” as it is mention in 1stWebDesigner website. I haven’t use any plugin in my websites; however the reviews of many other people said that it’s really intuitive to use, very friendly user the interface and it’s a free resource, which it is very interesting and could be a good source to use in my Big Project.  </p> 

<p>Web designers love to create websites with images, colors and galleries to make it more attractive; moreover, there are some sites that also have some nice animations in the website, but this is not an easy task to develop if you don’t know Maya or any other video editing tools. According to an anonymous blogger in 1stWebdesinger, “Slidea is a multipurpose content slider. This slider plugin was built on the jQuery, VelocityJS and Animus animation framework. With Slidea there are no animation limitations–you can so much awesomeness with it!” This option could be a great tool to use and develop some animations in an easy way to embed in my project. This toll offers a friendly interface making easier to the developer.  </p>

<p>The websites now in days should have a responsive website because the final users could be using any kind of screen. The statistics said that most of the users are reviewing the websites in their cellphones, and because of that the developers are working with mobile apps because it easier in a certain way, but more expensive developing. The famous website J Querry Mobile states that  
    “A binary "flip" switch is a common UI element on mobile devices that is used for binary on/off or true/false data input. You can either drag the flip handle like a slider or tap one side of the switch. 
    
    To create a flip toggle, start with a select with two options. The first option will be styled as the "off" state switch and the second will be styled as the "on" state so write your options accordingly. 
    
    Set the for attribute of the label to match the id of the input so they are semantically associated. It's possible to accessibly hide the label if it's not desired in the page layout, but we require that it is present in the markup for semantic and accessibility reasons.” 
    The Binary Flip it’s definitely a tool that I want to review and check to use in my big project. The website mention in more detail which attributes we should use in the CSS and in the HTML code, so I want to try it and see how nice can make my website watching it from a cell phone screen.   </p>
