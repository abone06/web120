<p><strong>Write:</strong> After doing some research about Shopping Carts, and their different use I review that there are some options of shopping carts using it as a software. This option is cloud based, well known as SaaS, shopping cart software solutions. These options are easier to implement in a website and quicker to install and maintain. This option have a good fit for some business that have a short inventory; in fact this kind of service could be so expensive in some occasions that the company could be paying more for this kind of service than what they are actually doing. However, if you are not a designer or a programmer the SaaS it’s a good solution, but the cost at the end could be a little higher.  </p>
    
<p>Website display and promotions – This is an option that includes the capacity to create offers, pages, and banners easily and without the necessity for complex back-end manipulation. You would want your online store to be quick to manage and the capacity to make changes as your product inventory changes, or discounts or specials are offered, is important. </p>

<p>Shipping and order management –This is another option, however the feature is overlooked when you are focusing on the overall look and feel of your site, but you should also consider how product orders are managed not only from an administrative perspective but also of the customer’s.  These issues become very crucial when your website is already up and running. </p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Support – </strong>This feature is something that many of the top shopping cart software vendors today provide various ways to get in touch with them or receive support, such as live chat features, phone and email support, video tutorials, FAQs, discussion board, and technical product documentation, among others. When researching for the right shopping cart software tool for your company, check the support platforms a vendor uses and how quick and accurate their customer responses are. </li>

<li><strong>Integrations –</strong> When researching for the right shopping cart software, also consider its integration features. Third-party tools include accounting programs, email marketing tools, shipping management, among others. Some market vendors have many of these integration features as paid add-ons while others offer them as part of their base service.  Make sure you check if there is at least an option for you to handle these data connections. Otherwise, your business will end up having to purchase for custom work later. </li>

<li><strong>Product management and upload –</strong> Creating product pages can be done manually if you are selling just a few dozen items. If you are selling more than that, then you have to consider how you can upload, edit, and manage all of those items. Almost all market vendors have the built-in capacities to handle this. However, some offer more complicated techniques than others. Some vendors likewise offer advanced features that others do not. </li>
</ul>

<p>Now in days there are a lot of websites that are trying to monetize using several type of content and options that there are available for the people. According to an anonymous user of Financials Online says that “shopping carts, also known as e-commerce website software programs, can be a complicated purchase for businesses“. I think this is the main reason that why people are trying to add more add-ins in to the website. The option of adding e-commerce could be so expensive right now that you can be in negatives numbers in case you have a small business.  </p>

<p>Due to the fact that most of the websites are trying to do things to get more money, the online stores are complicated for some business, especially if those are starting because even though right now we have some SaaS tools to add in the website. The cost of this could be high for small business. Helen Goulovela a storyteller from xCart, mention that “A few years ago creating an online store seemed mind-blowingly complex for medium and small businesses. You had to code your fingers to the bone to make your first sale. Luckily, everything is different now. Indeed, it’s never been easier to start an online store from scratch within just a short space of time.” This meaning that the companies need to invest in the online store in a certain point. In fact, this is right, but I can say that after some research I have seen some other options that offer a good price to start for small business. So, you can start with those tools after creating something from scratch because if the website does not work, you didn’t make a high invest in your website.</p>

<p>The companies have to make a big design, planning, and working with the statistics of the probably revenue they are thinking to create with their business model; however this metrics can reach the goal or not, and because of that the companies most understand if they want to work in a store online in the traditional. Helen Goulovela from xCart says that   “Building an online store the traditional way, with a warehouse and inventory, will cost you nearly as much as starting a dropshipped online store. </p>

<p>You will only need to put aside money for your initial cost of goods. </p>

<p>The total sum can range from a few hundred dollars to many thousands of dollars. It depends on the type of products you choose to sell and the kind of marketing activities you choose to use to grow your store when it is already set.” Saying that I think the companies should work a lot in the types of strategies they want to use and how they are going to attack in the market, because there are many ways to create your store online; moreover, they probabilities to fail are higher and could reflect in a big loss.  </p>
