<p><strong>Research:</strong> Since our final project will be about creating a BIG project we need to understand more about the responsive websites vs the Mobile applications. I research about “how do responsive websites compare to mobile applications” </p>

<p>I search in the website thinkmobile, which I found useful to understand some of the difference between responsive websites and Mobile applications:  <a href="https://thinkmobiles.com/blog/responsive-website-vs-mobile-app/"> https://thinkmobiles.com/blog/responsive-website-vs-mobile-app/ </a></p>

<p>I also found very useful the site SMASHTACK because this site focus more in the pros and cons of using each type: <a href="https://www.smashstack.com/articles/the-pros-and-cons-of-mobile-apps-vs-responsive-web-design/ "> https://www.smashstack.com/articles/the-pros-and-cons-of-mobile-apps-vs-responsive-web-design/ </a>
</p>
 

<p><strong>Gather: </strong></p> 

 

<p><a href="https://thinkmobiles.com/blog/responsive-website-vs-mobile-app/"> https://thinkmobiles.com/blog/responsive-website-vs-mobile-app/ </a> - A mobile website is available for all users. Since the mobile websites do not required to download or do some installation makes it available for anyone; moreover, most of the sites are free. Without matter the operating system a responsible website, it is easy to see and use in your mobile using a responsive website. However, it is important the user counts with internet connection, but most of the websites needs this. </p>

<p><a href="https://thinkmobiles.com/blog/responsive-website-vs-mobile-app/"> https://thinkmobiles.com/blog/responsive-website-vs-mobile-app/</a> - The site is easier to do some updating, supporting and bug fixing. On opposite to mobile apps, a user does not have to install the new version to see the enhancements on the website. For the most part, users do not even notice the process of updating. They can simply enjoy the renewed product. At the same time, it is easier and cheaper for an owner to update one website. </p>

<p><a href="https://thinkmobiles.com/blog/responsive-website-vs-mobile-app/"> https://thinkmobiles.com/blog/responsive-website-vs-mobile-app/</a> - The mobile website cost less. You do not have to create native apps for each type of mobile phones and tablets when you have one responsive website. It also makes maintenance cost lower and working with gets SEO easier. However, responsive website cannot satisfy all the needs and you still have to pay for domain and hosting. </p>

<p><a href="https://thinkmobiles.com/blog/responsive-website-vs-mobile-app/"> https://thinkmobiles.com/blog/responsive-website-vs-mobile-app/ </a>- Special user-friendly design. Talking about a design in a mobile app tends to be more resistant because there are a variety of screen sizes that might appear on the various phones and tablets. Making the design for a mobile app is typically more holistic and user-friendly as it is done for a specific platform. The pictures usually upload faster and the app itself uses less mobile data. </p>

<p><a href="https://thinkmobiles.com/blog/responsive-website-vs-mobile-app/"> https://thinkmobiles.com/blog/responsive-website-vs-mobile-app/</a>- The Apps can work offline. According to the app’s functions, you can download information or content and use it even without Internet access. For instance, most features continue working offline in applications like BBC news or Spotify.</p> 

<p><a href="https://thinkmobiles.com/blog/responsive-website-vs-mobile-app/"> https://thinkmobiles.com/blog/responsive-website-vs-mobile-app/</a>- using of mobile phone components. Mobile app can use some components making the site better since it is possible to use hardware sensors like microphone, camera, GPS, etc., that improves  the user experience acting with a device and makes user’s life easier. 
</p>

<p><strong>Write:</strong> After doing some research about the difference between responsive website vs mobile app, I conclude that both have pros and things that we should work more to make the user experience friendly and easier. Some of the things that I would like to mention about this two options are the following: </p>

<ul>
<li><strong>The Compatibility. -</strong> The mobile app will be helpful for this; however we need to develop several apps for the different platforms. In fact, the responsive we need to work more in the different seizes that can be available for the users and will take time; however we can have similar results, but one requires more time and effort.</li>

<li><strong>The Audience. – </strong>The people that will have access to the apps are limited to those who have smart phones, tablets and maybe some TV’s can have. On the other hand a responsive website anyone with access to a device with internet can have access to the website. </li>

<li><strong>Cost of entering the market. –</strong> The Mobile App will have a cost of the price that each store of the platforms that we want to have presence, and with a responsive website the cost will be the domain and the hosting.  </li>

<li><strong>Ease of use. - </strong> The Responsive website does not require any installation making it easier for the user by just typing the URL of the website, while in the mobile app the user nee to install the app store, have good network to download the app and also storage in their device to use it. </li>

<li><strong>Working offline. -</strong> The responsive website have a big limitation since the user will require internet connection.  In fact, the mobile app can work offline or some features can work fine without internet. This will depend of how the app was programmed. </li>

<li><strong>Support, updates and bug fixing. –</strong> The Mobile App have a more complex situation talking about support, updates and bugs, since the owners of the app they need to work coding the new features or the problems in the different platforms, and release that version in the app store and wait until the users download the new version vs the website that you can fix it or add the new features in your domain and any user will have access as soon as its uploaded in the server. </li> 
</ul>

While making some research about the benefits between mobile and or a responsive website, Kirs from SMASHSTACK mention that  “Creating mobile responsive mobile websites is the older, and perhaps less fashionable, of the two options. In most cases, the benefits of responsive web design encompass two critical areas:</p>  

<ul>
    <li><strong>Time: </strong>Launching a mobile site is a faster process than designing an application. Nearly all businesses these days need mobile sites to stay competitive anyway, so creating a responsive mobile experience is the least that developers can do. </li>

<li><strong>Cost:</strong> Responsive web design is comparatively cheap when measured against the costs of designing a native mobile app from the ground up.” </li>
    
</ul>

<p>Helping me to understand that creating a website or a mobile app needs time, knowledge and could be expensive in contrast to the responsive website. Which I can lose some user experience, but could be a good way to start. </p> 

<p>While making the research I saw a common question form different people, and Kris from SMASHSTACK answered with another question “Perhaps a better question would be, which is best for you?” I think this is the correct questions because both options have pros and cons, but the only person that can answer that it’s ourselves. This development of the site or app should be according on our budget and what do we need to sell.  </p>

<p>The option of having a mobile app or a website, must be a decision making depending of what things would we want to show, how must money we can invest in the website, and if we have the knowledge to program the app in different platforms. The site ThinkMobiles, make a declaration about “Thus, both alternatives have their advantages and disadvantages. A mobile app is not always better than the mobile version of the site and vice versa. To choose one of them you must understand the purpose of the product: who will use it and how often.” That I think we need to define exactly what should we want to do first, define our audience, and how often will be used before deciding between working on a mobile app or a website.
